# stitch.js

Stitch.js is an open library for computational embroidery with Javascript. It differs from other libraries in its focus on creating embroidery patterns which are resolution agnostic. An artist working with the library simply defines the geometry of the pattern and the library will handle all of the steps necessary for scaling that pattern for any output dimensions.
